## SLA Verification
The traffic_simulator.py program contained in this repository can be used to generate load against a service.  The log generated by the program will track the distribution of the service response latency.  If response latency exceeds the SLA for the service, the traffic_simulator.py program will terminate.  

Thus, this program permits us to apply load (requests/second) against a service, and measure the resulting latency.  The maximum load at which latency SLAs are still met is the **capacity** of the service.

Mode of input to the program: command-line.
Mode of output from the program: log print-outs.
Mode of input/output can be readily re-worked, as needed.
